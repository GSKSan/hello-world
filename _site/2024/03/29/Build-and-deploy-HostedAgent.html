<p>When I created this website, I was using github actions to deploy the app to the azure static web app.
Nothing wrong in that.
All works good.</p>

<p>But I have a good pc that is sitting idle doing nothing (I bought it to play games).
So I want to utilise to do some work.</p>

<p>I created a devops agent in it a couple of months ago to practice for my AZ-400 exam.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-did">What I did?</h2>

<p>I decided to use my agent to run my pipeline.</p>

<p>Easy, right?</p>

<h4 id="pipeline-yaml">Pipeline Yaml</h4>

<p>Simple, create a yaml file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">azure-pipelines.yml</code>.</p>

<p>We are going to define our steps and tasks for our deployment.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest

steps:

- task: AzureStaticWebApp@0
  inputs:
    app_location: "./" # App source code path
    api_location: "" # Api source code path 
    output_location: "_site" # Built app content directory
    azure_static_web_apps_api_token: $(deployment-token)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AzureStaticWebApp</code> lets us to build and deploy the app. So we dont have to do extra steps such as downloading ruby, jekyll and deploying.</p>

<p>All we need to cofigure the app location and output location in out case is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_site</code> becaue its a jekyll project.</p>

<p>Oh I forgot, we need to get <strong>deployment-token</strong> from azure.

<p><em>Commit the file to the github repo</em></p>

<h4 id="azure-devops">Azure devops</h4>

<p>After creating pipeline, we need to the intall this app from Github marketplace <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/azure-pipelines">Azure pipelines</a></p>

<p>For creating the actual pipeline, you need to have Azure devops organisations and a project. You can configure it when you install the github app.</p>

<p>Add the token the pipeline variable</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/pipeline-variable.png" alt="Pipeline variable" /></p>

<p>Save and run the pipeline.</p>

<p>If everything is good, you should see the deployment went through sucessfully.</p>
