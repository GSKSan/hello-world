It is a scorecard that assess a project's security risks by running automated checks.

It is mainly used for open source projects.

    - Maintined
    - Binary-Artifacts
    - Token-permissions
    - Vulnerabilities
    - Signed-Releases
4. Critical
    - Dangerous workflow

These are the vaious risks that can be addressed to get good marks 

As seen in the picture, my score is pretty low `4.2` when I wrote this post.

#### How to implement

This can be done in two ways
1. Github actions
2. CLI

CLI option is for running locally.
I have gone for github action. Its easy like adding the workflow directly from the `Actions` tab.

Then adding the badge to the Readme.md to showcase your score

```

```

#### Conclusion
This is good way to know more about the securoty risks and also way to assese your repository.
I will try address my repo's security risks and improve my score :)

see ya!
